                Wild Circus is a Canadian circus company founded in 2007 by Claire Peridoux and Adam Wild.
                Their love for circus and experiences as aerial skills performers led them to set up Wild Circus.
                Established in a former theater, in the Chinese district of Montreal, Claire and Adam have refurbished the
                location with the support of the Montreal Arts Council.
                They recruited the best performers from around the world to create classical circus shows with a modern twist.
                The company now employs 40 artists and proposes 20 performances and keep creating new acts each year for
                the pleasure of children and adults alike.
                Wild Circus have toured all around the world performing at international festivals such as the Fringe
                Festival in Edinburgh, the Burning Man in the Nevada desert.
