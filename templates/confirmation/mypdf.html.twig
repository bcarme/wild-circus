                returned or exchanged, except if the event is cancelled or the organiser decides to refund the tickets.
                A ticket cannot be resold at a higher price than the face value.
                Events take place under the sole responsibility of the organiser. Wild Circus cannot, in any circumstances, be held liable.
                If a cancellation or change in the date, time or place of an event for which you have reserved seats is announced,
                you agree to Wild Circus, as much as possible and after having been informed by the organiser,
                using the contact details you gave when making your reservation to keep you informed of the steps to take.
                In any case, we advise you to check for any changes 24 hours before your event, by telephone on 01.41.57.32.19 or in one of our sales outlets.  </p>
